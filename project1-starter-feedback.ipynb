Confirm your impression of normality by creating a box and whisker plot to see if you have outliers that lie outside of the interquartile range for each variable, and calculate the skew and kurtosis of the data. Finally, use the pandas \"describe\" command to obtain a summary of information about the variables including the mean and standard deviation. "
