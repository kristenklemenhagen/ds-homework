    "Answer: The purpose of this analysis is to attempt to predict the probability of admission to graduate school, based on undergraduate GPA, GRE score, and a prestige ranking of the applicant's undergraduate institution. The outcome measure is admission decision (0=reject; 1=admit), and predictors are GPA (integer), GRE (integer), and prestige (categorical from 1-4, 1 being the highest prestige). The data were supplied by UCLA/yhat, and were not identified by a specific year or major/area of study. "

    "Answer: Logistic regression was the main methods used to predict admission probability based on the independent variables GPA, GRE, and prestige. Logistic regression is used to predict a binary dependent outcome variable based on one or more independent variables. Dummy variables were created for the prestige data to make them categorical, because although they were provided as the integers 1-4, is is unknonwn if there was a linear relationship in the rnaking where a \"4\" school was 4 times worse than a \"1\" school. Since prestige had 4 levels, 3 dummy variables were required to describe it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Odds and odds ratios of admission were calculated from tabulated data to get a sense of overall patterns of admission. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the primary logistic regression, we used admit as the binary outcome variable, and gre, gpa, prestige 2, prestige 3, and prestige 4 as the independent variables. Constant and intercept terms were added, as the statsmodel function requires explicit definition of constants and intercepts. The result of the logistic regression gives estimates for the coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals. These coefficient estimates are then exponentiated [np.exp()] to convert them from log-odds to odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we evaluated our model by looking at every combination of variables to see how each variable influences the others in predicting the probability of admission. A range of linearly spaced values within the ranges of each variable was created to aid in visualizing the relationships between the variables. "

    "Answer: By calculating the odds and odds ratios, we can observe that the odds of receiving an acceptance to graduate school if you attended a prestige school ranked 1 compared to any other school is approximately 1.8. The odds ratio of prestige 1 school applicants compared to all other applicants is about 3.1, so you are 3.1 times more likely to be admitted to graduate school if you attended a prestige 1 undergraduate school. Conversely, for students who attended a prestige 4 school, their odds of admission were approximately 0.4, or 60% lower than students who went to prestige 1, 2, or 3 ranked schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the logistic regression, we found estimates of the coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals. Prestige 1 was set as the baseline level, so an odds ratio of .51 for prestige 2 predicts that students from a prestige 2 school are .51 times (or 49% less likely) to be admitted to graduate school than students from a prestige 1 school. The odds for prestige 3 students were 0.26, and for prestige 4 students, they were 0.21, demonstrating that the lower the number of prestige (and therefore the higher the ranking of the school), the higher the predicted probability of admission is. \n",

As the students' school prestige lowers, so do their admission chances, despite the perfect GRE score being held constant (prestige 3: 42%, and prestige 4: 37%)."

    "Answer: The results of analyzing this dataset of admission probability given GRE, GPA, and undergraduate school prestige indicate that all three of the independent variables contribute to the probability of admission, with higher levels (lower actual numbers in the case of prestige) contributing positively to the student's chance of admission. From the combinations of variables examined, it appears that undergraduate school prestige contributes more to the chance of admission, since for example, a prestige 1 student with a GPA of ~2.2 has about the same chance of admission as a student from a prestige 3 school with a 4.0 GPA, and a higher chance of admission than a prestige 4 student with a 4.0 GPA, with the same pattern holding true for GRE scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "In future steps, I might be interested in examining the variable of prestige more in-depth. What kind of prestige is positively associated with graduate school admissions? Is it primarily academic or activity-based, or is it sports-based prestige? I would attempt to split prestige into a greater number of more specific categories to examine this. I would also like to examine prestige over more schools than just this school (UCLA?). Perhaps this school is an outlier in giving such high weight to undergrate school prestige in graduate admissions. Within the same school, I would like to examine whether this pattern is true for all areas of study, or if it is more common in one type of field, such as in the arts or in engineering. "
